# Oral-History Application

A photo-documentation site made to review and remeber
the life, work and projects of my late Father Paul D. Sehnert. 

When he became ill, we worked together to develop a collection
of his important belongings and all the memories (oral history) associated with them. 

The site will include photos of these items and the stories, explanation and history behind them. 
Admin approved account holders such as family members and close family friends will be able to upload
their own images and comment on images across the site. 


### Technical guid
I want to be clear that the foundation for this site was taken from (technically, coded along with)
Traversy Media and the NetNinja, in the [following youtube upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUe91uOx7R0) 

I coded along with the project while familiarizing myself with the ReactJS framework. After reaching
the completion of the upload, available in the [final commit of their Git repo](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/firegram/tree/final-files) all proceeding design, implementation, documenting and testing was done by myself.

As a quick note to other developers, the above mentioned youtube upload and associated src code
is a great resource for learning React as well as the fundementals of modern web design.
It goes to great lengths to explore some of the more abstract concepts of how a image viewer site is
constructed, including many assumptions, taken for granted, that even a seasoned developer may overlook.
My highest praise goes to Brad and Shaun, who are some of the more didactic
and helpful uploaders in the youtube and coding tutorial ecosystem. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
